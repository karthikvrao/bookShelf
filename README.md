# Book Shelf App

This app allows user to manage books on a shelf. User will be able to add/delete books and authors.

The app is intended to eventually work with a back end. Currently the front end works as a standalone single-page-app.

## Running the app

To run the app right away:
* Open a terminal window.
* Clone the project repo in the desired directory, change to frontend directory and then start the dev server.
    - `git clone https://github.com/karthikvrao/bookShelf.git`
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm start`
